= Overview

== Background

This code was initially written at the GMOD Evolutionary Biology Hackathon 2010 at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent, National Science Foundation Grant # EF-0905606 ) in Durham, NC.

== Purpose

The initial goal was to add the nd modules from CHADO to the ActiveRecord layer.  Those models are now present here, but without tests. 

== Caveats
